# Nonprofit-Career-Planner

## User Story

As a person looking to begin a career in the non-profit sector, I would like to know about career prospects in different parts of the country. I want to input a city and obtain a list of nonprofit organizations. In addition, to make an informed decision about where to work, I also want information about average rent.
